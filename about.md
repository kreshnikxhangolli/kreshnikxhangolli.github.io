I am an energetic and passionate data scientist. As part of the MSQ/PhD Program in Quantitative Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt, 
I have spent the past 2 years taking Ph.D. level courses in Statistics and Econometrics, to tailor my previous mathematical background (
B.A. in Mathematics) into Data Science and gain robust theoretical knowledge in statistical inference (modelling, estimation and testing) 
and machine learning. 

My approach to machine learning is multifaceted; from statistics, coding, and economics. I believe that only with a
good grasp of the algorithm and subject theory information one can carefully consider the implications of the many assumptions 
made in these two aspects, both implicit and explicit. Instead the coding skills are necessary if one wants to
leverage the computational power made possible by today's technology.

I will try to spare the reader yet another blog that regurgitates R-bloggers and will try to present original work or usefeul code.
